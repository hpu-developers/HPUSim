We have 5 benchmarking scenarios - 

Naive serial execution:

We simply add up execution cycles of each task serially along with the system's interrupt latency.

(1) apps_no_dependency.asm:

Accelerators : dict_keys(['real_fir', 'complex_fir',                 'adaptive_fir', 'iir', 'vector_dot', 'vector_add', 'vector_max',     'fft_256', 'dct_64', 'correlation', 'lbeg', 'lend', 'mul', 'add',    'mov', 'if'])
Task completed -  1 real_fir ( cycle  1163 )
Task completed -  1 complex_fir ( cycle  5101 )
Task completed -  1 adaptive_fir ( cycle  9727 )
Task completed -  1 vector_dot ( cycle  12419 )
Task completed -  1 iir ( cycle  12714 )
Task completed -  1 vector_add ( cycle 13087  )
Task completed -  1 vector_max ( cycle  13384 )
Task completed -  1 fft_256 ( cycle  32389 )
Task completed -  1 dct_64 ( cycle  33505 )
Task completed -  1 coorelation ( cycle  34500 )
Task completed -  1 real_fir ( cycle  35663 )
Task completed -  1 complex_fir ( cycle  39601 )
Task completed -  1 adaptive_fir ( cycle  44227 )
Task completed -  1 vector_dot ( cycle  46919 )
Task completed -  1 iir ( cycle  47214 )
Task completed -  1 vector_add ( cycle  47587 )
Task completed -  1 vector_max ( cycle  47884 )
Task completed -  1 fft_256 ( cycle  66889 )
Task completed -  1 dct_64 ( cycle  68005 )
Task completed -  1 coorelation ( cycle  69000 )

For every other case, it would take 69000 cycles to complete the entire stream of task. Presence of dependency would not matter as one starts exectuing a new task only when its previous task has completed.

For 'loop' based apps, we add one cycle for each mov instructions(6 cycles) and one cycle for each add (4*5 = 20). Adding interrupt latency and task execution cycles, it accumulates to 47669 cycles. 

In case of 'if' conditions, in the absence of HTS, it would have to be resolved by CPU itself. Since we are performing DRAM access for branch resolution, we would add 123 cycles for it and assume that it does perfect branch prediction, which makes it 69123 cycles for all apps_branch*.asm

Software scheduled execution:

We assume that an established software runtime does a similar out of order processing, but would have interrupt latency to deal with.

For computation purposes, we simply pick up each test case outcome in HTS and add tasks*interrupt latency to it. In our opinion, we are massively under-estimating the execution time. To top it all off, we are not entirely sure about the realisability of such a out of order software task scheduler (runtime).

OoO (1 acc per kernel):

We have a heterogenous system with one accelerator per task.
